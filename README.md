# bgpt - Bash GPT CLI Tool

A command-line tool that translates natural language commands into bash commands using OpenAI's language models.

## Installation

```bash
pip install bgpt
```

## Usage

Before using `bgpt`, make sure you have the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set with your OpenAI API key. You can also set the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variable if you are using a custom OpenAI endpoint, and the `LLM_MODEL` environment variable to change the model. The default model is GPT-4.1-mini.

Example:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
export LLM_MODEL="GPT-4.1-mini"
```

```bash
bgpt <natural language command>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
bgpt create a folder named my-folder
bgpt list all files in the current directory
bgpt show me the contents of my_file.txt
```

The tool will now print the generated bash command directly to standard output. It no longer includes an interactive confirmation or execution step. You are responsible for reviewing, editing (if necessary), and executing the command in your shell.

## Shell Integration

Since `bgpt` now prints the suggested command to standard output, you can integrate it into your shell workflow with wrapper functions. These functions can capture the output of `bgpt` and place it into your command line buffer for review, editing, and execution.

Here are examples for Zsh and Bash:

### Zsh

Add the following function to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```zsh
# Add this to your ~/.zshrc
function ai_cmd() {
  local cmd
  # Replace 'bgpt' with the actual path if it's not in your PATH
  cmd=$(bgpt "$@")
  if [[ -n "$cmd" ]]; then
    print -z "$cmd" # This places the command in Zsh's edit buffer
    # zle accept-line # Optional: uncomment to automatically execute if you don't want to edit
  else
    echo "bgpt did not return a command."
  fi
}
# Usage: ai_cmd your natural language query
# Example: ai_cmd list all text files
```

After adding this and reloading your `~/.zshrc` (e.g., by running `source ~/.zshrc`), you can type `ai_cmd your query here`, and the command generated by `bgpt` will appear in your prompt, ready for you to edit or execute.

### Bash

Bash does not have as straightforward a way to directly inject text into the current command line buffer as Zsh. Here's a function that copies the command to the clipboard (if `xclip` is available) or prints it for manual copying. Add this to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
# Add this to your ~/.bashrc
function ai_cmd() {
  local cmd
  # Replace 'bgpt' with the actual path if it's not in your PATH
  cmd=$(bgpt "$@")
  if [[ -n "$cmd" ]]; then
    if command -v xclip > /dev/null; then
      echo -n "$cmd" | xclip -selection clipboard
      echo "Command copied to clipboard: $cmd"
      echo "Paste (Ctrl+Shift+V or Cmd+V) to edit and run."
    else
      echo "Suggested command: $cmd"
      echo "(Install xclip for automatic copy to clipboard: sudo apt-get install xclip)"
    fi
  else
    echo "bgpt did not return a command."
  fi
}
# Usage: ai_cmd your natural language query
# Example: ai_cmd find all files modified yesterday
```
After adding this and reloading your `~/.bashrc` (e.g., by running `source ~/.bashrc`), you can use `ai_cmd your query here`.
